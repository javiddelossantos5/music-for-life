      <h3>Jill Boyd</h3>
      <h5>Music Composer</h5>
      <p>
        Jill Boyd is an American composer, pianist, clarinetist, and local piano teacher. She is most known to us in Vernal for playing in the local band The 8 Tease, playing piano at Alive After 5, and her 1st place finish with the song "Epic" at the Uintah County Fair talent show. She is formerly known as, "The Numbers Composer," for her talent in composing piano pieces on the spot from any four numbers. That venture led her to compose over 300 piano songs in a two-month time frame; and she continues to receive custom requests years later. 
        <br>
         While she loves the ease and speed of writing piano pieces, she has also been catching the attention of multiple orchestra conductors across the U.S. Jill's most recent accomplishments include the honor of "in-house composer" for the West Valley Cadet Strings, where her chamber orchestra pieces have been commissioned the past five years. She's also written arrangements for UHS Orchestra, as well as for local, stake, and regional choirs.  Her first full orchestra piece, "Epic" was premiered Spring of 2019 by the Uintah Basin Youth Chamber Orchestra. Since then, she's studied more orchestration, and has spent some time tapping into the tv/film industry with two tracks under contract waiting for a placement. She is a wife, a mother of four, and enjoys running, gardening, outdoor adventures with her family, and watching the stars.

      <h3>Lora Staples</h3>
      <h5>Violin Teacher</h5>
      ​<p>
        Lora Staples is a fiddler and teacher living in Kingman, Arizona. She currently plays with the eclectic band "Gateway", with the Flagstaff Symphony, and has recently played in the bluegrass band "Buffalo Nickel", and the Celtic/Contra-Dance band "Leaping Lulu". 
      </p>
      <p>
        She started her violin studies at age 10 in the public school system, and it quickly became her focus and passion. She earned a Bachelor's Degree in Violin Performance from the University of Utah and a Master's Degree in Music from Wichita State University. She has played professionally in numerous orchestras and pit orchestras and has been the featured soloist with several orchestras. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Her focus was always on performing until 1998, when an accident involving a finger on her left hand forced her to consider other options. At that time, she discovered her second love, teaching. She became a certified Suzuki teacher, ran a full studio of 40+ students of all ages for several years, and has since applied those same concepts to her fiddle teaching. 
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2010, she founded "Red Desert Violin", which now provides online violin and fiddle instruction to people in over 35 countries. She loves helping people overcome their obstacles and watching how music positively impacts every aspect of people's lives.

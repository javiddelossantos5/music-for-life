    <h1>Why Take Music Lessons?</h1>
    <p>
      The number of studies conducted in regards to music lessons and the impact on child development is virtually endless. Researchers have found a link between music lessons and improved self confidence, intellectual ability, motor skills, and social skills. Correlations have also been found between music lessons and increased concentration, coordination, and relaxation. Other studies show that students in top-quality music programs tend to outperform peers that are not in music programs. Research such as this begs the question, “Why would you not take music lessons?”

    <h3>Annual Events</h3>
    <p>
      Our younger students are offered the opportunity to perform music at regularly scheduled public recitals. These events are designed to be fun and exciting for children, parents, and our community. They provide the opportunity for our students to showcase their efforts in front of a live audience. Music for Life students perform at care homes during the Christmas season, a dress-up show for Halloween, a spring formal recital, and an ice cream performance in the summer. Many of Music for Life’s students can also be seen performing in several of the different Vernal area school talent shows and charity events.

    <h5>Tips For Overcoming Performance Anxiety</h5>
    <p>
      It's not uncommon to be nervous about starting a new venture in life.  The fear of the unknown is something that has plagued humanity since the beginning of civilization; from getting a new job, to that upcoming test at school, not knowing the outcome of an event can sometimes cause a person a great deal of stress.  
    </p>
    <p>
      This is a popular subject for our students before an upcoming recital.  Performance anxiety can be scary, but it can also be overcome.  It's normal for a student to be a little nervous before they go on stage for the first, and sometimes second or third time, but there are many ways to conquer this feeling.  
    </p>
    <h5 class="stress">Make Stress Your Friend  -Especially When Performing!​</h5>
    <p>
      Stress. It makes your heart pound, your breathing quicken and your forehead sweat. But while stress has been made into a public health enemy, new research suggests that stress may only be bad for you if you believe that to be the case. Psychologist Kelly McGonigal urges us to see stress as a positive, and introduces us to an unsung mechanism for stress reduction: reaching out to others.
